I create this class becuase my teacher give me the home work, first I search for it but I see no answer that there are actually these method in Character class in Java so I started writing my own character class But it doesn't check char type for these five method will take String as a parameter and will return boolean if datapass in is in codition (defualt is return falsy value for what ever that doesn't make sense in checking type)

some of problems: 
check for operator
check for symbol
check for lowe csae
check for decimal
check for space

I use string becuase some of problem upthere requests not one single character like decimal (point number) that char type cann't hold multiple character.
